# Northcoders News

The current production version of this project is live and available at: [lm-nc-news.netlify.app](https://lm-nc-news.netlify.app)

## About

Northcoders News is a social networking application built using **React** and **TailwindCSS**. It was developed during my enrolment in the **Northcoders JavaScript Software Development Bootcamp (September - November 2024)**.

The goal of this project is to provide users with the ability to perform full **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations on articles and comments. I plan to implement these features by early 2025.

The backend for this project is hosted in a separate repository, which you can explore here: [Backend Repository](https://github.com/Mchumbles/be-nc-news).
