Northcoders News

The current production version is deployed at https://lm-nc-news.netlify.app

About
This project replicates a basic social network application. It was built with React and TailwindCSS as part of my enrolment on the Northcoders JavaScript Software Development Bootcamp (2024). It enables users to perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on articles and comments. It also utilises efficient state management and client-side routing to provide a responsive, mobile-first experience.

The backend API is a separate project and can be found here: https://github.com/Mchumbles/be-nc-news
